## About Me

I am a current student at Warren Tech, taking the Computer Science/Cybersecurity course, as well as a student at Green Mountain High School  
In both places I strive for being the best student that I can and submit my best possible work whenver possible

Outside of school I love going outside and adventuring, often climbing, whenever possible
